**Leaflet and interactive maps in R**

*Description:* "Good maps are essential to communicating spatial science effectively. Static maps can only communicate so much though, especially when what we're trying to show is complex or has multiple layers of data associated with it. Interactive data visualisation is the new black and Leaflet is the easiest and most powerful way to achieve this in R. I'll introduce you to Leaflet and get you making awesome looking interactive maps."

*Presenter:* Dr. James Lawson is a postdoc in Rachael Gallagher's Plant Ecology and Conservation Lab at MQU. He is developing conservation planning software in R Shiny that helps decision makers choose the best sites to manage threatened species.

*Date:* Aug 22, 2019. Time: 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM. Venue: Continuum Room (75 Talavera Road, room 3114). Snacks provided, BYO mug.
